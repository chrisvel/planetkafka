## What is Kafka?

Quoting [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Kafka):

> _**Apache Kafka速** is an open-source stream-processing software platform developed by LinkedIn and donated to the Apache Software Foundation,
written in Scala and Java. The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling real-time data feeds.
Its storage layer is essentially a "massively scalable pub/sub message queue designed as a distributed transaction log," making it highly
valuable for enterprise infrastructures to process streaming data. Additionally, Kafka connects to external systems (for data import/export)
via Kafka Connect and provides Kafka Streams, a Java stream processing library._

Following the official [introduction](https://kafka.apache.org/intro) for Apache Kafka速:

> _**Apache Kafka速** is a distributed streaming platform_

As both wikipedia and the official introduction do a great job in describing what **Apache Kafka速** is, there is no need to attempt explaining everything here (again).
